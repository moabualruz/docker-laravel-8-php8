   ```

## Remember

The configuration of the database **must be the same on both sides** .

```dotenv
# .env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=db_name
DB_USERNAME=db_user
DB_PASSWORD=db_password
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret
```

```dotenv
# source/.env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=db_name
DB_USERNAME=db_user
DB_PASSWORD=db_password
```

The only change is the `DB_HOST` in the `source/.env` where is called to the container of `mysql`:

```dotenv
# source/.env
DB_HOST=mysql
```

## Special Cases

To Down and remove the volumes we use the next command:

```sh
docker-compose down -v
```

Update Composer:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm composer update
```

Run compiler (Webpack.mix.js) or Show the view compiler in node:

```

Run all migrations:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate
